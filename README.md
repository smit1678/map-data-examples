Example Data and Map Projects
=================

This is a repository of various map and data projects. Clone the repo to your local machine and use these examples as starting points to working with TileMill and other open source mapping tools. 

This is a work in progress. These projects are meant to be starting points to playing with map styles and techniques for creating maps with TileMill. Feel free to contribute. 

### Folders

`tilemill`

Drop the the folders here into your local TileMill project folder, or point your TileMill to the local version of this repository and you can get working on these examples. Each project is self-contained with data housed in each folder.
